            back papers to grade from home. I would sit with her and read some of the answer approaches 
            for the pupils, and it was very interesting. I wanted to engage with them to learn how they come

            I've been following a lot of industry leaders and experts, and I've been really amazed by

            only be a great opportunity for me to learn from other industry experts, but it would also allow me 
            to give back to the community that has given me so much. I'm confident that I would have valuable insights 
            and experiences to share, and I'm excited to start exploring speaking opportunities in the near future

                        <p className="text-slate-300">
                            I'm a firm believer that life is all about following your passions, where you start
                            must not define where you should end up,
                            and that's exactly what led me to where I am today.
                            I worked as a field plumber to partially pay for my college tuition. While studying 
                            biomedical engineering in college, I already knew that my true passion was 
                            for software development, I just didn't know how to start.
                            After graduation, I worked for a year as a biomedical engineer in a grade 3 hospital in northern uganda. 
                            I saved up money and invested in a 5-week web development bootcamp, 
                            which turned out to be a life-changing experience for me.
                            I decided to take a leap of faith and switch my path, which led me down an exciting and rewarding path.
                            After the bootcamp, I continued to teach myself and dive deeper into the world of software development. 
                            I started focussing on learning everything I could about programming, and I draw inspiration from 
                            developers like Kent C Dodds. I started studying React, React Native, and Node.js
                            Looking back on my journey so far, I'm proud of how far I've come and excited about what the future holds. 
                            I know that there will always be new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm eager to 
                            continue pursuing my passion for software development.
