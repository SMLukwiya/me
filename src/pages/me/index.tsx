            I've been playing for several years and I have some mean handles, I have twisted many

            I picked up in secondary school
            I find that playing basketball also helps me stay focused and disciplined, which I 
            think translates well to my work as a software developer.

            write about. But growing up, my mother was a teacher in a local christian school, she always used
            to bring papers to grade back home and I would sit with her and read some of the answer approaches 
            for the pupils, and it was very interesting. I wanted to engage with them to learn how they come
            up with such interesting approaches.

            I've been following a lot of industry leaders and experts, and I've been really amazed by 
            the insights and perspectives they bring. I believe that speaking at technical conferences would not 
            only be a great opportunity for me to learn from other industry experts, but it would also allow me 
            to give back to the community that has given me so much. I'm confident that I would have valuable insights 
            and experiences to share, and I'm excited to start exploring speaking opportunities in the near future
            That's why I am giving a talk at my countries DevFest this year in December.

                            Some may argue that 5 years is too short to claim seniority in development.
                            Which is a very valid argument.
                            But to me, seniority is something I strive for every single day of the week, and

                            I'm a firm believer that life is all about following your passions, where you start
                            must not define where you should end up,
                            and that's exactly what led me to where I am today. After initially studying 
                            biomedical engineering in college, I already knew that my true passion was 
                            for software development. 
                            After graduation, I began working as a biomedical engineer in a grade 3 local hospital. 
                            I saved up some money and decided to invest in a 5-week web development bootcamp, 
                            which turned out to be a life-changing experience for me.
                            I decided to take a leap of faith and switch my path, which led me down an exciting and rewarding path.
                            After the bootcamp, I continued to teach myself and dive deeper into the world of software development. 
                            I started focussing on learning everything I could about programming, and I was particularly inspired by 
                            developers like Kent C Dodds. I started studying React, React Native, and Node.js
                            Looking back on my journey so far, I'm proud of how far I've come and excited about what the future holds. 
                            I know that there will always be new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm eager to 
                            continue pursuing my passion for software development.
